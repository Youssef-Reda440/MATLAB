# Activity 1 – Point Operations and Coordinate Systems

## Overview
This activity focuses on performing basic operations on points represented in different coordinate systems using MATLAB.

## Given
- Point **A** in Cartesian coordinates: (1, 3, 4)
- Point **B** in Spherical coordinates: (r = 5, θ = 180°, φ = 90°)

## Objectives
- Compute the sum of two points.
- Compute the subtraction of two points in the cylindrical coordinate system.
- Validate MATLAB results using analytical calculations.
- Comment on the obtained results.

## Implementation
- Point **B** is converted from spherical to Cartesian coordinates.
- Point addition is performed directly in Cartesian form.
- Point subtraction is carried out and the result is expressed in cylindrical coordinates.
- MATLAB built-in functions are used alongside manual transformations.

## Output
- Cartesian coordinates for point addition.
- Cylindrical coordinates for point subtraction.
- Results consistent with theoretical calculations.

## Notes
All operations follow standard definitions of coordinate systems used in vector analysis.
