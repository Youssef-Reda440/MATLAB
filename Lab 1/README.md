# Lab 1 – Vector Operations and Coordinate Systems

## Overview
This lab introduces basic vector operations and coordinate system transformations using MATLAB, with a focus on practical applications in vector analysis.

## Objectives
- Perform addition and subtraction of points and vectors.
- Work with Cartesian, Cylindrical, and Spherical coordinate systems.
- Evaluate vectors at specific points in space.
- Validate numerical results using analytical calculations.

## Lab Activities
- **Activity 1:**  
  Operations on points expressed in different coordinate systems, including point addition and subtraction.
  
- **Activity 2:**  
  Vector addition and subtraction where vectors are defined in mixed coordinate systems and evaluated at specified points.

## Implementation
- Points and vectors are evaluated at given locations as specified in each activity.
- Coordinate transformations are performed using MATLAB built-in functions and unit vector transformation matrices.
- All vector operations are carried out after converting quantities to a common coordinate system.

## Output
- Cartesian results for vector and point addition.
- Cylindrical or Cartesian results for vector subtraction, depending on the task.
- Results verified against manual mathematical calculations.
