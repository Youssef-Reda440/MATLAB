# Activity 2 – Vector Operations in Cartesian and Cylindrical Systems

## Overview
This activity focuses on performing vector addition and subtraction where vectors are expressed in different coordinate systems and evaluated at specific points.

## Given
- Vector **A**:  
  A = −3xy uₓ + 2z uᵧ + u_z  
- Vector **B**:  
  B = −5 u_φ − 8 u_z  

## Objectives
- Compute the sum of vectors in Cartesian coordinates at point (0, 0, 1).
- Compute the subtraction of vectors in the cylindrical coordinate system at point (1, 0, 0).
- Validate MATLAB results using mathematical calculations.
- Comment on the obtained results.

## Implementation
- Vector **A** is evaluated directly at the specified point using Cartesian coordinates.
- Vector **B** is converted from cylindrical to Cartesian coordinates using unit vector transformations.
- Vector addition and subtraction are performed after expressing both vectors in the same coordinate system.
- MATLAB built-in functions and transformation matrices are used for validation.

## Output
- Cartesian vector result for vector addition.
- Cylindrical vector result for vector subtraction.
- Results consistent with analytical calculations.

## Notes
All operations follow standard vector analysis definitions and coordinate system conventions.
